This is Ultimate BÃ¼chi Automizer a tool for analyzing termination of C programs.
    


Requirements:
64bit Linux system with Java



Usage:
If you want to analyze termination of the program foo.c then execute the
shellscript
./buchiAutomizer.sh foo.c
The first line of stdout will be either MEMORYSAFE or NOT_MEMORYSAFE.
If the program was memory safe, the second line of stdout will be either 
TERMINATING, NONTERMINATING, or UNKNOWN.
Afterwards a lot of debuggig output is written to stderr (if you don't want to
see this execute ./buchiAutomizer.sh foo.c 2> /dev/null).
