## Open issues
  * ``broken-patterns.txt`` describes issues with existing patterns that can be parsed and interpreted, but where the interpretation is misleading. 
  * ``not-implemented/`` contains patterns which are simply not implemented (i.e., there is no countertrace) 
  * ``scope-issues/`` contains patterns that can never be part of an rt-consistency because the system just avoids entering the scope altogether.
      TODO: Might need some examples and more explanation. 
  * ``toggle-issues/`` contains different issues with the toggle pattern (may be already fixed as soon as ``broken_patterns.txt`` is fixed)
