req1: Globally, transitions to states in which "O" holds occur at most twice
req2: Globally, it is always the case that if "I" holds, then "O" holds as well
req3: Globally, it is always the case that if "!I" holds, then "!O" holds as well
req4: Globally, it is always the case that if "!G && !O" holds, then "O2" holds as well
req5: Globally, it is never the case that "!G && !I" holds
