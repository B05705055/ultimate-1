R1: Globally, it is always the case that if "a" holds for at least "1000" time units, then "!out" holds afterwards for at least "2000" time units.
R2: Globally, it is always the case that if "b" holds, then "out" holds after at most "500" time units.

// ????? 
// Requirements R1, R2 are rt-inconsistent
// We found a FailurePath: 
// 0    a=* b=* out=*
// 500  a=true b=true out=false
