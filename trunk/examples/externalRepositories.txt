Further examples can be found in the following repositories.

the SVCOMP repository has changed to https://github.com/dbeyer/sv-benchmarks


As it is more complicated with git to checkout only parts of the repository
(and because Dirks description on the SVCOMP mailinglist lacked some
information), here a short introduction how I got the latest SVCOMP C
benchmarks on monteverdi. I assume you want to make a fresh clone. 

# create a directory
mkdir svcomp
# make it a fresh git repository
git init
# add the remote from which you want to pull later 
git remote add origin https://github.com/dbeyer/sv-benchmarks

# tell git that you want to use sparse checkouts
git config core.sparsecheckout true
# create a file that will describe what you want from the remote repo, e.g. by using touch 
touch .git/info/sparse-checkout
# say that you, e.g., only want the folder c/ containing the C benchmarks 
echo c/ >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
# get all your benchmarks without the history ("--depth=1")
git pull origin master --depth=1

The whole directory will then be approx. 5GB

If you for some reason modify the sparse-checkout file, you have to run the
following command (from your repo root) to inform git about your change: 
git read-tree -mu HEAD

Now, the sad part: git does not support any way of changing the folder
structure. You end up with svcomp/c/... and no way to change this (if you
want to pull). 
But we need the examples in a special place, because our tests assume this. 

I used a symlink on monteverdi to map svcomp to our examples folder, like
so: 
ln -s /storage/svcomp/c /storage/ultimate/trunk/examples/svcomp

Under Windows, open "cmd" as Administrator and use mklink:
mklink /D Drive:\path\to\ultimate-repo\examples\svcomp Drive:\path\to\svcomp-repo\c
