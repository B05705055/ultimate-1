# Ultimate
Ultimate is a program analysis framework. Ultimate consists of several plugins that perform steps of an program analysis, e.g., parsing source code, transforming programs from one representation to another, or analyze programs. Toolchains of these plugins can perform complex tasks, e.g., verify that a C program fulfills a given specification.
